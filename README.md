# SIADS593-milestone1-project
This project looks into relationships between a country's agricultural and livestock production and zoonotic outbreaks within those countries. 

**Note** that the Visualizations in the notebooks don't show up unless the notebook is downloaded then re-uploaded to Jupyter Labs due to an issue with rendering on GitHub.
